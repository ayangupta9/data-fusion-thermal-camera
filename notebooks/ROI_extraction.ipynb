    "We will start with adjusting the color space\n",
    "From some EDA, I have found LAB, LUV and YUV colors spaces to be useful for ROI extraction task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the current pipeline\n",
    "- Convert RGB image into another color space (possibly LAB)\n",
    "- Extract L channel and apply enhancement using `convertScaleAbs` function from cv2 [alpha = 2.0, beta=-50]\n",
    "- Dilate image to increase ROI area\n",
    "- Apply binary threshold on the image with threshold value of 200\n",
    "- Applying `findContours` on the thresholded image\n",
    "- Fetch each contours area and sort in descending order.\n",
    "- Pick highest contour area objects and create bounding boxes using `boundingRect`\n",
    "- These will be used as ROIs for extraction of hot liquid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Need to apply some kind of technique to identify how many objects are there in the frame. \n",
    "    - Also, how do we know the ROI is actually a coffee mug or glass or something else.\n",
    "        Template Matching, or maybe some other technique. \n",
    "            Some kind of edge detection\n"
